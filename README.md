## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Although this is a project that mainly we can develop in HTML and CSS, I developed it in React as an unique component and CSS for the styles. The most important part was how to make responsive this component only using Flexbox and how to make transition between the normal and active state in the hover status.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using React as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, among others
